# Add natspec comments for main public functions

Severity: Informational

Type: Documentation

### Recommendation

Consider adding natspec comments to improve the clarity of the codebase and to make it easier for other projects to integrate with the Ruscet Contracts. Currently there is very little documentation associated with the codebase, making it difficult to quickly understand the functionality of certain functions.
